# Assignment 6 - 1D Creature
In this assignment, I generate a snake with a random amount of links between 2-8, color coding links based on if sensor neurons are present. There is a 50% chance of a link having a sensor neuron, and the shapes are random yet slightly elongated to more closely resemble a snake.
